HashMap increment resulted in correct value of 4000
Lock increment resulted in correct value of 40
RWLock W increment resulted in correct value of 40
RWLock RW increment resulted in correct value of 80
All tests passed. This doesn't mean everything is correct, just that no bugs were uncovered by the test(s) that were run.
No threads ready or runnable, and no pending interrupts.
Assuming the program completed.
