$$
The child process’s x value is not shared with parent. Thus the modification is not reflected in the parent process. Function excevp() loads a new program and thus wipes out the parent’s code. But if for any reason, loading this program (shell) fails, the print statement (x=11,y=1) does appear. The order of printing is fixed because the parent process waits the child process.
